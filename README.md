Krishi Mitra (कृषि मित्र) - A Smart Awareness Portal for Farmers 🚜

"Krishi Mitra" is a full-stack, AI-powered web application designed to provide comprehensive, real-time, and personalized support to Indian farmers. Built with Python (Flask) and powered by the Google Gemini AI, this portal goes beyond static information to offer interactive, intelligent tools.

This project was created as a B.Tech (Computer Science) project.

Team: Shivam Kushwaha, Satyam Patel, Sagar Kushwaha

Institute: Shri Ram Institute of Science & Technology, Jabalpur

🚀 Core Features (प्रोजेक्ट के मुख्य फ़ीचर्स)

This portal is built on 9 "Smart" (स्मार्ट) features that make it unique:

🧠 AI & Smart Advisory

🤖 AI Chatbot (with Voice): A smart assistant powered by Google Gemini (Text) API & Web Speech API. Farmers can ask questions like "What is Hydroponics?" and get instant answers in Hindi/English with voice output.

🌿 AI Plant Disease Diagnosis: Farmers can upload a photo of a sick leaf. The Gemini Vision API analyzes the image and provides an instant diagnosis and treatment plan.

🌾 AI Crop Selection Advisor: Based on soil type and location, the AI suggests the best crops to grow (using Google Search grounding).

⚠️ AI Weather Risk Advisor: Warns farmers about risks (e.g., "Don't spray pesticides tomorrow, rain is expected") by combining weather data with AI logic.

🛒 Marketplace & Tools

🚜 Rental Marketplace (OLX for Farmers): A platform where farmers can rent tools (tractors, drones) from each other or local shops.

📦 Live Inventory Search: Farmers can search for specific items (e.g., "Urea") in their city ("Jabalpur") and see real-time stock availability from registered shops.

🏪 Dual-Role System: Separate dashboards for Farmers (to buy/rent) and Shopkeepers (to manage inventory).

📊 Real-Time Data & Utilities

☀️ Live Weather: Real-time weather updates (Temperature, Humidity, Wind) using the OpenWeatherMap API.

🧪 Soil Testing Tracker: Digital submission and tracking of soil samples for lab testing.
